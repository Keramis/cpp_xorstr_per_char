# cpp_xorstr_per_char
A XOR-STR encryption for strings, on a per-character basis.

Takes a 8-bit string key (ones and zeroes, ex. "10110010") and a string input.

I know that I can use bitwise XOR, but letting the user choose the 8-bit key as a string makes it easier for me to use everything as a string. Maybe I'll update it later with a different method.
